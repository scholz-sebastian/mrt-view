; This is a comment line (line starting with a semi-colon)
; In this file, you can specify additionnal text overlays to be displayed 
; on images according to their modality (CT, MR...) or their SOP Class prefix.
; The SOP Class prefix is a short character string defined for each DICOM Storage SOP Class,
; and used internally for DICOM filenames.

; So, for example, for Ehhanced CT images, SOP Class prefix is CTe, but modality is CT.
; Traditional Computed Tomography images have CT for both modality and SOP Class Prefix value.
; Historical Secondary Capture images have SC for SOP Class prefix, but may have CT, MR, US, ...
; for modality..
; For a given image, a [section] related to SOP Class prefix is searched before.
; If not found, a [section] with image modality is searched.
; If not found, a [section] named [DEFAULT] is searched.

; The following keywords set the locations where you can show the annotations:
; 	TR: Top Right
; 	BR: Bottom Right
; 	TL: Top Left
; 	BL: Bottom Left

; References to DICOM tags can be specified as follows:
; 1) Using the following syntax: %gggg,eeee where 'gggg' is the 
;    group value, and 'eeee' is the element value.
; 2) Using the tag names as they exist in the image DICOM information and 
;    specifying them between the < and > characters.
; For example, %0010,0010 and <PatientsName> both refer to the same DICOM tag.

; To find tag values and names, open an image and press the F2 key.

; --
; Some keywords may be used for "dynamic" information. They are the following:
;		$IMGNUMBER
;		$MODALITY 
;		$POSITION
;		$WINDOWING
;		$SERIESNUMBER
;		$LATERALITY
; You can also ask for a given modality NOT to display hardcoded overlays.
; Just start your modality section with NO HARCODED OVERLAY


; --
; Character fonts
; You may redefine the 4 default character fonts if you wish.
$TL FONT Verdana,8
$TR FONT Verdana,8
$BL FONT Verdana,8
$BR FONT Verdana,8
; When defined at this level, they will be the fonts used by default for all images.
; However, if such lines appear in a [modality] section, they will only concern this modality.

; The initial content of this file defines as a sample 3 overlay sets :
; - One for CT images,
; - One for OP (Ophtalmic) images,
; - One for other images.

; CT Images
; -----------
; 6 empty lines on the top left and KVP.
; On the top right, the institution name, and on the next line, 
; the patient's sex, age and the acquisition date.
; Define a dedicated section for Enhanced CT images, as some information may be located
; in the SharedFunctionalGroupSequence. Here find KVP value here.
